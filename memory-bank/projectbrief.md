# Project Brief

## Core Requirements

This project aims to create a .NET caching library SDK. The library will provide a simple and efficient way to cache data in-memory.

## Goals

- To create a functional, well-documented, and easy-to-use caching library.
- To learn more about .NET SDK development.

## Project Scope

The scope of this project is to build a caching library with support for in-memory caching. Future extensions could include support for distributed caches like Redis.
