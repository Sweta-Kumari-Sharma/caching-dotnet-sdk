# System Patterns

## System Architecture

The caching library will have a core `Cache` class that manages the cached items. This class will use a `ConcurrentDictionary` to store the cache entries, ensuring thread safety. A background service will be responsible for periodically checking for and removing expired items.

## Design Patterns

We will likely use the following design patterns:

- **Singleton Pattern:** To ensure there is only one instance of the cache manager.
- **Options Pattern:** To configure the cache (e.g., capacity, expiration).
- **Decorator Pattern:** To add additional functionality, such as logging or metrics, to the cache.

## Component Relationships

This section will contain diagrams and descriptions of how the different components of the SDK interact with each other.
