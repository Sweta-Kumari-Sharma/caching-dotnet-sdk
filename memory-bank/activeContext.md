# Active Context

## Current Work Focus

The current focus is on designing and planning the implementation of a .NET caching library.

## Recent Changes

- Decided to build a .NET caching library.
- Updated the Memory Bank to reflect the new project direction.

## Next Steps

1.  Define the public API for the caching library (e.g., `ICache` interface).
2.  Design the internal data structures for storing cache items.
3.  Implement the core caching logic (add, get, remove).
4.  Implement the expiration and eviction policies.
5.  Create a sample project to test the library.

## Active Decisions and Considerations

- We need to decide on the specific eviction policy to implement first (e.g., LRU).
- We need to consider the performance implications of our design choices.
- We should aim for a simple and intuitive API.
